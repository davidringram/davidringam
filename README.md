## 🎯 THE MISSION

This repository houses the digital infrastructure for **David R. Ingram**, a Fractional Chief Marketing Officer specializing in high-trust, high-ticket local economies.

I operate at the intersection of **Brand Strategy**, **Data Science**, and **Revenue Operations**. I do not just hand clients a map and wish them luck; I build the roads, secure the supply lines, and lead the expedition.

## 🛠 THE ARCHITECTURE (Marketing Engineering)

This platform is built for speed, SEO dominance, and modularity. It serves as a live demonstration of my "Marketing Engineering" capabilities.

- **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation for zero-layout-shift performance).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS / Starwind UI.
- **Design System:** Custom OKLCH color scale engineered for deep tactical contrast (Dusty Olive, Burnt Orange, Gunmetal, Mist).
- **Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline integrated directly from this repository.

## 🛡 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

I engineer revenue systems; I do not act as IT support.

- **I generate demand;** I do not close the deal for your sales team.
- **I define the visual identity;** I do not push pixels in Canva.
- **I design the field strategy;** I do not book the event catering.
